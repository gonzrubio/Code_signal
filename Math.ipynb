    "# Eucleidan algorithm (GCD) for N numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "The largest common divisor (GCD), also called highest common factor (HCF) of N numbers is the largest positive integer that divides all numbers without giving a remaninder.\n",

    "Write an algorithm to determine the GCD of N positive integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Input\n",
    "* num - an integer representing the number of positive integers (N).\n",
    "* arr - a list of positive integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Output\n",
    "Return an integer representing the GCD of the given positive integers\n",

    "##### Test cases\n",
    "* num = 5, arr = [2,4,6,8,10]\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Solution\n",
    "This algorithm (Eucleidan algorithm) is based on the fact that H.C.F. of two numbers divides their difference as well.\n",
    "In this algorithm, we divide the greater by smaller and take the remainder. Now, divide the smaller by this remainder. Repeat until the remainder is 0.\n"
